# insideterminal

My simple <strong>node.js/mongodb/angular.js/bootstrap project</strong>. I did this for learning purposes. Small website where users can share their terminal knowledge. Useful for terminal noobs. Website has a Frontend and admin Backend. Authentication was done with passport.js. This website is not live, I need to fix backend css. For now is just a messy html, but it does the job :) :)
